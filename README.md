A Nintendo Entertainment System emulator that is written in python

## Why ?

Why not. This is a project designed as an educational experiment so I can do two things:

* learn how to emulate hardware in software.
* use that knowledge to then learn other languages.

I know python pretty well - I've been using it professionally for (insert flex) years
and a I'm pretty comfortable with it (no error; good program).

I've always wanted to learn how to write an emulator, but I don't know other
more suitable languages to do that in - so I thought why not just write one in python.
Is writing a emulator in python a good idea ? The really depends on your motivation.

Then I can implement the same emulator in other languages and *bing bong boom* I've become
a `giga-polyglot-chad programmer`.

## Rules

1. When Mario can jump, I've finished.
