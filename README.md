A Nintendo Entertainment System emulator that is written in python

## Why ?

Why not. This is a project designed as an educational experiment so I can do two things:

* learn about how to emulate hardware in software
* use the knowledge gained in this project to then learn other languages.

I know python pretty well - I've been using it professionally for 10 years now and am
pretty comfortable with it. I've always wanted to learn how to write an emulator,
but I don't know other more suitable languages to do that in - so I thought why not
just write one in python. Is writing a emulator in python a good idea ? The really depends
on your motivation - in my case I think it a nice way to get an understanding of how this
works (i.e. the NES), implement in something I know I can and then using the knowledge I
have here implement the same thing Rust or Go or Typescript (3 languages which I want more
coding experience in)

## Rules

1. I don't want to look at other peoples code - I want to try and work this out using first principles
2. The aim is not to create a 'good' emulator but rather something that just works i.e. starts a game and gets to the title screen

This isn't a new concept - there are alot of emulators for the nes written in python - here are just a few

As stated in rule 1 - I'm not to use these as reference - I don't what to simply copy a solution
but rather create my own - all I've seen of these repos is there README and root project structure.

From what I can tell everything I need is here:
